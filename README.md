# Lori Tanksley Art

A site built to practice my React skills and conceptualize my art business.

## Description

I started building this site for fun to start implementing some of the React features 
I've learned so far, such as props and components. I've also used this as an opportunity
to learn a new UI library, Material-UI. 

## Technologies Used

* React.js
* Material-UI
